# Book Explorer

This repository contains a web application for searching books using the Google Books API. The project is built with Bun, Elysia, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **public/**: Contains static frontend files.
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript for the book search interface.
- **src/**: Contains backend source code.
  - `index.ts`: The main backend file using Elysia to serve the frontend and provide a book search API endpoint.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.
- `bun.lockb`: Bun lock file.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration.

## Features

The Book Explorer offers the following features:

- **Book Search**: Search for books by title or author using the Google Books API.
- **Display Results**: View book titles, authors, thumbnail images, and links to more information.
- **Frontend Search**: The `index.html` file includes client-side JavaScript that directly calls the Google Books API.
- **Backend API Endpoint**: An Elysia endpoint (`/books/:name`) is available to perform server-side book searches via the Google Books API.

## Technical Implementation

The application is built using:

- **Bun**: A fast JavaScript runtime, bundler, and package manager.
- **Elysia**: A fast, lightweight, and type-safe web framework for Bun.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe backend code.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For the frontend user interface.
- **Google Books API**: Used to fetch book data.

## Requirements

- Bun runtime installed on your system.

## Getting Started

To get the project running locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd bun-elysia-google-books
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    bun run src/index.ts
    ```
4.  Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`.

You can use the search bar on the page to search for books directly from the frontend, or you can access the backend API endpoint at `http://localhost:3000/books/:name` (replace `:name` with your search query).

## API Documentation

API documentation generated by Swagger is available at `http://localhost:3000/docs`.
